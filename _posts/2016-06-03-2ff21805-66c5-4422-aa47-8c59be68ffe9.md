# Welcome!

Welcome! You've somehow managed to stumble upon my little blog. I'm so glad you're here! Here at Mo's we will talk about all kinds of things in life! Those little things that are part of what I would call a "modern vintage" or "mod" life. Just some of the things I will post about include cooking/baking, green and zero waste living, lots of mommy/baby stuff, DIYs and crafts, and maybe a little style/fashion! I hope you join me on this little journey. And if you like my posts, check out the website often so you don't miss anything! 

Cheers,

Monica (aka Mo)
